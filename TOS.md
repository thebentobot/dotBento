The information provided through our Services is not intended for distribution to or use by any person or entity in any jurisdiction or country where such distribution or use would be contrary to law or regulation or which would subject us to any registration requirement.

## 8) Modifications, Availability & Uptime

The Services may change or be discontinued at any time without notice, including security patches, added/removed functionality, or policy changes.

The Services are provided **“as is” and “as available.”** We disclaim all warranties, express or implied, including merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement.
