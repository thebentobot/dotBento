## What information is collected

We may collect personal information that you voluntarily provide to us when you
express an interest in obtaining information about us or our products and
Services, when you participate in activities on the Services, or otherwise when
you contact us.

Through our Bot, we may collect personal information related to you that Discord
provides to us through the Discord API (in this case, we refer to Discord End
User Data).

The personal information that we collect depends on the context of your
interactions with us and the Services, the choices you make and the products and
features you use within our Service and within the Discord servers that you
share with Bento.

By adding Bento or joining a server with Bento, the information we collect may include:

### Automatically collected data

* User ID
* Username (and discriminator where applicable)
* Avatar URL
* Messages for XP (not the content of messages; only that a message event occurred to increment XP)

**We do not access or store the content of your Discord messages.** Our XP feature only records that a message event occurred; it does not log what was said.

### Website login via Discord (OAuth2) & Cookies

When you sign in on our Website using Discord, we receive limited public Discord
profile information from Discord: your Discord user ID, username (and
discriminator where applicable), and avatar URL. We store these fields in our
database to create and maintain your account and to verify your session.

**Cookies used for sign-in (strictly necessary):**

* **Session cookie**: Keeps you logged in and ties your browser session to your account. Set as HTTP-only and Secure with an appropriate SameSite value. Expires on logout or after 7 days of inactivity.
* **CSRF token**: Helps protect your account from cross-site request forgery. Expires at the end of the session or after a short period.

We do not set non-essential cookies (such as analytics or marketing) without your consent. If we add such cookies in the future, we will request consent and update this policy and our Cookie notice.

**Legal basis:** performance of a contract (providing your account) and/or our legitimate interests in providing and securing the Service.

---

## How your information is used

We use personal information collected via our Services for a variety of business
purposes described below. We process your personal information for these
purposes in reliance on our legitimate business interests, in order to enter
into or perform a contract with you, with your consent, and/or for compliance
with our legal obligations. We use the information we collect or receive to:

* Offer our services to you (including Discord End User Data obtained via the Discord API or information you provide directly).
* Request feedback and contact you about your use of our Services.
* Send administrative information to you (e.g., product, service and new feature information and/or changes to our terms, conditions, and policies).
* Protect our Services (e.g., for fraud monitoring and prevention).
* Enforce our terms, conditions and policies; comply with legal and regulatory requirements; or perform our contract with you.
* Respond to legal requests and prevent harm (e.g., in response to a subpoena or other legal process).
* Authenticate Website users via Discord OAuth and maintain sessions.
* Operate XP and other features without storing message content.

The personal information we process may be used for the following purposes:

* **Discord ID:** to identify you across our Services and in relation to your Discord End User Data.
* **Discord OAuth profile fields (username/discriminator where applicable and avatar URL):** to create and maintain your Website account and personalize your experience.

We do not access or store Discord message content for our features at this time. If we introduce a feature that requires processing message content in the future, we will update this policy and clearly describe the scope and retention.

**Specific use cases:**

* **Discord User Profile:** Your username, profile picture, and any data related to your Discord user profile is provided via the Discord API based on your Discord ID, only when needed.
* **Statistics:** When statistics are provided by our Services, we only keep aggregated and anonymized data in our database.
* **Website Accounts:** When you sign in with Discord on the Website, we create an account record containing your Discord user ID, username (and discriminator where applicable), and avatar URL.

## How your information may be shared

**In short:** We only share information with your consent, to comply with laws, to
provide you with services, to protect your rights, or to fulfill business
obligations.

In general, we have no business needs that justify, nor direct interests in,
sharing your information with other entities.

We may process or share your data that we hold based on the following legal
bases:

* **Consent:** If you have given specific consent to use your personal information for a specific purpose.
* **Legitimate Interests:** When it is reasonably necessary to achieve our legitimate business interests.
* **Performance of a Contract:** Where we have entered into a contract with you and need to fulfill its terms.
* **Legal Obligations:** Where we are legally required to do so to comply with applicable law, governmental requests, judicial proceedings, court orders, or legal processes (including responses to public authorities for national security or law enforcement requirements).
* **Vital Interests:** Where necessary to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding potential violations of our policies, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the safety of any person, illegal activities, or as evidence in litigation.

**Service providers (subprocessors):** We use third-party providers to host and deliver our Services. This currently includes **Hetzner** (infrastructure/database hosting) and **Cloudflare** (security/CDN). Where personal data is transferred outside the EEA/UK, we rely on appropriate safeguards (e.g., Standard Contractual Clauses).

## How long information is kept

We will only keep your personal information for as long as it is necessary for
the purposes set out in this privacy policy, unless a longer retention period is
required or permitted by law (such as tax, accounting or other legal
requirements).

When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal
information, we will automatically delete your data if you're out of the scope of our services, or, if this is not possible
(for example, because your personal information has been stored in backup
archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it
from any further processing until deletion is possible.

**Website session cookies** expire on logout or after 7 days of inactivity.
**Account records** created via Discord sign-in (Discord user ID, username/discriminator where applicable, avatar URL) are kept while your account remains active and are deleted within a reasonable period after account deletion or prolonged inactivity.

---

## How we keep your information secure

We have implemented appropriate technical and organizational security measures
designed to protect the security of any personal information we process.
However, please also remember that we cannot guarantee that the internet itself
is 100% secure. Although we will do our best to protect your personal
information, transmission of personal information to and from our Services is at
your own risk. You should only access the services within a secure environment.

Examples of measures we implement include:

* **User Identification and Discord End User Data Processing:** Wherever possible, the only identification key related to you that is stored on our system is your Discord ID. Your username, message content, data you provide to Discord, etc. is accessed via the Discord API using your Discord ID, while a minimal amount of data is stored in our Services.
* **Encryption at Rest:** Data stored by our Services is encrypted at rest using industry-standard algorithms (e.g., AES-256-GCM).
* **Encryption in Transit:** Data processed by our Services, or transferred between different components of our infrastructure, is encrypted in transit (e.g., TLS 1.2+).
* **Authentication, Authorization, Auditing:** Security measures ensure only authorized users can access stored data.
* **Infrastructure Security:** Data is segregated into different components of our infrastructure with technical and organizational measures to minimize the chance of unauthorized access.
* **Operational practices:** Role-based access controls, regular security updates, and monitoring appropriate to the scale of our Services.

*(Note: We avoid overclaiming specific technologies beyond what we actually use.)*
